## Getting started üê£

Using this client assumes that you have an [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/)
server  installed and running.

You can install the client in your PHP project using [composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```bash
composer require lavamusic/elasticsearch-php-client "dev-main"
```

After the installation you can connect to Elasticsearch using the `ClientBuilder`
class. For instance, if your Elasticsearch is running on `localhost:9200`
you can use the following code:

```php
<?php

use LavaMusic\Elasticsearch\ClientBuilder;

$client = ClientBuilder::create()
    ->setHosts(['localhost:9200'])
    ->build();

// Info API
$response = $client->info();

echo $response['version']['number']; // 7.10.1
```
